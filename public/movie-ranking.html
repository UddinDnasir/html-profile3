<h1>The Best Movie according to Uddin</h1>
<h2>The top three movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bottoms</h3>
<p>this will be my favorite funny movie.Propulsive and over-the-top, Bottoms is an instant high school comedy classic that feels both current and nostalgic.<br />
   <p>Starring: Rachel Sennott, Ayo Edebiri, Havana Rose Liu, Kaia Gerber<br />
    Directed By: Emma Seligman<br />

<h3>Crater</h3>
<p>One of the best family movies of the year, "Crater" follows a group of teenagers living in a lunar mining colony. As the story unfolds, our young heroes set out on a quest across the moon's unforgiving terrain after one of their fathers dies in a mining accident. Crackling with Amblin energy, the coming-of-age sci-fi in many ways feels like "The Goonies" in space as it follows a bunch of young friends racing against the clock to find a hidden treasure before the world finally tears them apart.<br />
   
  <p> Starring: Isaiah Russell-Bailey, Mckenna Grace, Billy Barratt <br />
   
   Director: Kyle Patrick Alvarez<br />

<h3>When Evil Lurks</h3>
<p>Critics Consensus: A hard-hitting horror film whose surface-level frights are just as engaging as its thematic concerns, When Evil Lurks marks a viscerally unsettling addition to the possession horror canon.<br />
   <p>Starring: Ezequiel Rodríguez, Demián Salomón, Silvina Sabater, Virginia Garófalo<br />
       Directed By: Demián Rugna<br />
